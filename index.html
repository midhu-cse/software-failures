    <h1>INtroduction To software Failures: </h1>
    <div class="intro">
    <h5>Software failures occur when a 
      computer program or system does
       not perform as expected or intended,
        resulting in errors, malfunctions,
         or crashes. These failures can occur due
          to various reasons, including bugs in the code, incorrect handling of inputs, hardware issues, environmental factors, or unexpected interactions with other software components.
      Software is an integral part of modern life,
       powering everything from critical infrastructure 
       to personal devices and entertainment systems. However, despite 
       rigorous development and testing processes, software is not immune to failures. 
       Software failures can have significant consequences, ranging from inconvenience and financial
        losses to compromising safety and security.</h5>
