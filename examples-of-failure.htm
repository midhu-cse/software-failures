            <h3>Nest thermostat freeze
            </h3>
            <p>Software update for the Nest ‘smart’ thermostat (owned by Google) went wrong and literally left users in the cold. When the software update went wrong, it forced the device’s batteries to drain out, leading to a temperature drop. Consequently, the customers could not heat their homes or use any amenities.</p>

            <h3>Nissan’s recall
            </h3>
            <p>For over 2 years, Nissan recalled over a million cars thanks to a software glitch in the airbag sensory detectors. Practically, the affected cars could not assess whether an adult was seated in the car’s passenger seat and consequently would not inflate the airbags in case of a crisis.</p>
