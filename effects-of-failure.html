      <h2>Some of the most common software failure include:</h2>
    <div class="intro">
<ol>
    <li><b>System downtime:</b> When software fails, it can cause the system or application to crash, resulting in downtime or unavailability of the system. This can lead to lost productivity, missed deadlines, and financial losses for businesses that rely on the software.</li>
<li><b>data:</b> Software failures can result in the loss or corruption of important data, such as customer records, financial data, or work documents. This
can be devastating for businesses, as it can cause reputational damage, legal liability, and financial losses.</li>
<li><b>Security risks:</b> Software failures can leave systems and data vulnerable to cyber attacks. Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the software to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, compromise systems, or spread malware.</li>
<li><b>User frustration: </b>When software fails, users may become frustrated or lose trust in the system. This can lead to decreased user adoption, negative reviews, and increased support requests.</li>
<li><b>Costly repairs:</b> Fixing software failures can be time-consuming and expensive. In some cases, the cost of repairing the software may be higher than the
cost of replacing it entirely.
<li><b>Legal liability:</b> In some cases, software failures can result in legal liability. For example, if a bug in the software causes a car accident, the software vendor or developer may be held liable for damages.</li>
